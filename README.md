# Private Events

This is a 'proof of concept' web application that allows users to create private events and invite other users. You can try it out [here](https://sheltered-stream-45982.herokuapp.com/).

It has the following features:

- Sign up as a new user entering username and email
- Log in using username (no password) and log out
- View your profile page
- Create new events
- Send invitations to other users
- View pending invitations and either accept or decline them
- View upcoming events
- View previously attended events

I made this app using Ruby on Rails as part of the Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/associations#project-2-private-events). As with other applications I've made recently, my focus was on the backend/framework side of things so there is no styling yet.
